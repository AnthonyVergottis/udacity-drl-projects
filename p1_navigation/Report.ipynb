    "The aim of this project is to explore a value-based method for solving the reinforcement learning problem. The algorithic implementation is based upon a simple Deep Q Network, implementing a model-free approach. The agent interacts with a enviroment whose state space is composed of 37 continious values. There are for possible actions for the actions space:\n",
    "- `0` - walk forward \n",
    "- `1` - walk backward\n",
    "- `2` - turn left\n",
    "- `3` - turn right\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the agent is to pick up yellow bananas (receiving a reward: +1) whilst avoiding blue bananas (receiving a reward: -1). The criteria for a good solution implementation require that the agent receives a average reward greater that 13 for 100 episodes. The simulation enviroment is provided by Unity ML."
